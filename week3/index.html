        <li>I learned how to create an object and assign it values.</li>
        <!--<li>Performed math functions with Javascript</li>
        <li>Experimented with different types of inputs</li> -->
    </ul>

    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Why would you use a name in an object with a space and not just capitalize the second name?</li>
        <!--<li>When would it be ok to use var for a variable?</li>
        <li>Is using inputs types a good way to validate inputs?</li> -->

            This week the reading was covered some things I had been 
            introduced from earlier programming classes. I was even familiar
            with Javascript functions. It was good to get some reading on 
            variables and what the best way to use them is. I think I got
            the answer to my questions about assigning variables. I think the 
            answer is to use let.  
        </p>

            One thing I used this week with inputs that I haven't used much
            before is placeholders. That is a way to inform the user what they 
            are to enter. This can help with mobile design and presrving space 
            when it would take up to much space to use labels.
