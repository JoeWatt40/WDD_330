        <p>This week I completed the TODO tutorial. It was a very interesting project that was
            really fun to complete. I created a TODO list by following a 2 hr video. I took me 
            much longer than two hours, because I had to go over stuff and figure out quite a 
            few problems that came up. In the end I was able to complete the app.
