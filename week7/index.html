    <div>
        <p>The callback function is used to continue running the program while
            you are waiting for something to finish its process in the program.
            The Promise function gives you a future result of an asynchronous 
            operation, which is how JavaScript runs. It gives you one of two results,
            it is either "Resolved" or "Rejected".
